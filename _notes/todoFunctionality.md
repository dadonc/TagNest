## Initial plan 
* Initial literature review and assessments for this module
* cleanup and refactor codebase
* support different item types: pdf, groups, audio, text, other
* rewrite chrome extension
* top area: quicksettings, home and back buttons
* settings view
* user highlights: video timestamps, highlights in bookmarks
* item order
* bugs
* styling
* interviews
    * landing page for user evaluation
* handle existing files, make paths relative




Probably out of scope:
* Search
* Import view - better overview, indicator
* autogenerate type tags
* undo/redo




* item groups
    * group: icon indicating it is a group,  number of items in the group, user can choose the main item to be used as preview
* pdfs: preview of the first page
* other files: default icon or, if possible, a preview of the default icon/application on the user's system
* right click on an item opens a context menu: edit item, show file in finder, open in default application, open in browser, delete item

* main top area: settings
* details top area: "home" button, back button

* fix/limit settings view

* keyboard nav

* landing page for user evaluation

* users should be able to use the application without reading the documentation


* tag input bug
* Handle already existing files
* Make paths relative
* Item order
* Import - better overview, indicator
* Chrome extension


LIMITATIONS:

Ublock doesn't run, not completely everything is saved, e.g. fonts, embedded audio and video
Possibly problems with the highlights due to mhtml
No way to access the stuff using a mobile device
