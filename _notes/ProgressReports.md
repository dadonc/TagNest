## Report 1
The last two weeks I have 
* fixed a problem with my usage of electron-forge which didn't allow me to package the application. This now works again.
* added support for audio files - both the preview as well as the detail view are now able to play audio files and show their duration.
* added support for video files - detail view is finished, the preview still needs some work.
* added support for text files - the first 100 chars are displayed in the preview, the detail view allows users to read and edit the whole file.
* struggled way too long with CSS and layout issues. I believe I now have found a good solution and have a better understanding of the problem

Plan for the next two weeks:
* finish the video preview
* fix some issues with videos: some file types don't work (which ones exactly?), the correct resolution is not always displayed
