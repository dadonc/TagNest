# Weekly Progress Reports
The last two weeks I have 
* fixed a problem with my usage of electron-forge which didn't allow me to package the application. This now works again.
* added support for audio files - both the preview as well as the detail view are now able to play audio files and show their duration.
* added support for text files - the first 100 chars are displayed in the preview, the detail view allows users to read and edit the whole file.
* struggled (way too long) with CSS and layout issues. I believe I now have found a good solution and have a better understanding of the problem

Plan for the next two weeks:
* work on the item type "video"
* work on some of the many issues in my bugs and issues list. E.g, deletion of items in the DetailView doesn't work.
