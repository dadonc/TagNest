## Testing

I have tried to anticipate as many edge cases as I could (e.g. renaming a tag to an already existing one, importing already existing files and bookmarks, deleting files that have been imported using Finder) and found and fixed several more through extensive testing and my own usage of the application.

## Limitations

Ublock doesn't run, not completely everything is saved, e.g. fonts, embedded audio and video
Possibly problems with the highlights due to mhtml
No way to access the stuff using a mobile device
