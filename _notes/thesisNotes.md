## Testing

I have tried to anticipate as many edge cases as I could (e.g. renaming tag to an already existing one) and found and fixed several more through extensive testing and my own usage of the application.

## Limitations

Ublock doesn't run, not completely everything is saved, e.g. fonts, embedded audio and video
Possibly problems with the highlights due to mhtml
No way to access the stuff using a mobile device
